## ***10 Basic OOPS questions***
**Question 1**: Create a Car class with attributes like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class.
<br><br>

##
## ***Decorators***
**Problem 1**: Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.
<br><br>
**Problem 2**: Create a decorator to print the function name the values of its arguments every time the function is called.
<br><br>
**Problem 3**: Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments , the cacked value is returned instead of re-executing the function.
